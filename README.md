# Automated-Histopathological-Image-Classification-for-Diagnosis-and-Prognosis
The manuscript of my recent research project in medical image classification is available here.

Abstract:
Incorporating deep learning methodologies into the histopathological classification of images has fundamentally
transformed the field of diagnostic pathology, facilitating the automated, accurate, and highly efficient analysis of
tissue specimens. The research presents a comprehensive and robust framework that leverages transfer learning
and ensemble learning strategies to enhance classification performance on H & E stained Histological images.
We explore several state-of-the-art pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as DenseNet121,
InceptionResNetV2, Xception, NasNet mobile, MobilenetV2, ResNet50V2, and Vision Transformer (ViT), and
assess their individual and collective performance. A meticulous k-fold cross-validation approach was implemented
to ascertain model generalizability and robustness across a diverse array of histopathological samples. Our empirical
findings indicate that ensemble models surpass the performance of singular designs, achieving a validation accuracy
of 99.1% and an F1-score of 0.9908, which signifies enhanced classification performance compared to the existing
method. Moreover, this research addresses pivotal challenges such as data scarcity, inter-class similarities, and
intricate tissue morphology, demonstrating that deep learning methodologies can substantially elevate diagnostic
accuracy. The outcomes of this investigation contribute to the progression of computational histopathology,
facilitating the potential for more precise, automated, and scalable disease identification and cancer grading in
clinical pathology.
